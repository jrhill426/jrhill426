# Hi 👋 My name is Justin Hill
## Software Engineer

As a child, my two favorite subjects were math and literature. I believe my interest in programming comes from the unique way it combines these two fields, using mathematics to solve problems through the language of code. I find it exhilarating when beautifully crafted code mirrors the elegance of well-written prose, transforming words into images.

I've been working on the **Figma monetization team** recently, building out request access flows and scaling our payments model. 

Outside of software development, I love to ski, bike, run, and play soccer. I'm a big believer in working hard and playing hard.
